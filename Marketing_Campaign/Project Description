A response model can provide a significant boost to the efficiency of a marketing campaign by increasing responses or reducing expenses. 
The main objective is to predict who will respond to an offer for a product or service.
The secondary aim is to analyze which specific factors (i.e., consumer behaviour, anagraphic data etc.) mostly predict customer responding or not to the campaign.
The predictive model is expected to allow the company to maximize the profit of the next marketing campaign.
